 Returns YES if the target string is contained within the receiver.
 
 Same as calling rangeOfString:options: with no options, thus doing a case-sensitive,
 non-literal search.
 
 Added in iOS 8, retrofitted for iOS 7.
 
 @param aString The string to compare with.
 
 @return YES if the target string is contained within the receiver.
