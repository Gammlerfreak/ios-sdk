###2. CocoaPods setup

The easiest way to integrate the iOS SDK is via [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) [^2]. If you're new to CocoaPods, visit their [getting started documentation](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). 

````
cd your-project-directory    
pod init
````

Once you've initialized CocoaPods, just add the [Sensorberg Pod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SensorbergSDK) to your Podfile:

````
pod 'SensorbergSDK', '~> 2.0'
pod 'tolo', '~> 1.0'
````
[^2]: For instructions on including the Sensorberg framework and its dependencies manually see the guide on [alternative setup](http://link)

###3. Gettings started in Xcode

Objective-C

Include the Sensorberg SDK header in your app to get all the needed classes:
`#import <SensorbergSDK/SensorbergSDK.h>`

Swift

You can use the Sensorberg SDK in your Swift class by simply importing the module:

`import SensorbergSDK`

Before using the SDK you need to do some basic configuration.  
You can find your API key on the [Beacon Managerment Platform](https://manage.sensorberg.com) in the Apps section.

The SensorbergSDK uses an the [Observer pattern](http://codentrick.com/observer-pattern-in-mobile-eventbus-and-notificationcenter/) for events dispatching.  
During setup, you pass the class instance that will receive the events as the delegate.  
If you want to receive events in other class insances also, simply call `REGISTER()` and subscribe to the relative events.  

`[[SBManager sharedManager] setApiKey:<api> delegate:self];`
